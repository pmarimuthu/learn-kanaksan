# Inertia & Newton's First Law

<ConceptMeta chapter="4" section="4.2–4.5" page="56–60" />

<Predict
  label="What happens?"
  prompt="A bus brakes hard. Which way does a standing passenger lurch?"
  :options="[
    { text: 'Forward', correct: true },
    { text: 'Backward' },
    { text: 'Stays exactly still' }
  ]"
  reveal="Forward — your body keeps moving while the bus slows beneath you. That is inertia."
/>

::: idea
Things are lazy. An object at rest stays at rest, and an object moving in a straight line keeps moving the same way — **until some force makes it change**. This "resistance to change in motion" is called **inertia**.

Before Galileo, people thought a moving object naturally slows down and stops. Galileo realised it only stops because of an *external* force (friction, air). Remove the force and it would never stop.

::: formula
**If the net external force is zero, the velocity stays constant** (Newton's First Law):

$$\vec{F}_{net} = 0 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad \vec{v} = \text{constant}$$

This includes $\vec{v} = 0$, i.e. staying at rest.

Symbols:
- $\vec{F}_{net}$ — the total (net) external force, in newtons (N)
- $\vec{v}$ — velocity (speed *and* direction), in m/s
:::

::: real
You're standing in a bus. The bus brakes suddenly and you lurch **forward**. Nothing pushed you forward — your body simply *kept moving* while the bus slowed under you. That forward lurch is your inertia. The seatbelt or handrail provides the force that finally stops you.

Same reason: when the bus suddenly starts, you fall **backward**.
:::

::: try
Put a coin on a stiff playing card, and balance the card on the mouth of a glass. Now **flick the card sharply** sideways. The card flies off, but the coin drops straight into the glass.

Why? The quick flick acts on the card, not the coin. The coin's inertia keeps it in place until gravity pulls it down.
:::

::: whatif
What would it feel like to walk on a floor with *zero* friction? (Hint: friction is the external force your feet rely on. Without it, what happens every time you push back?)

<Quiz
  question="A car turns a sharp corner and you feel pushed toward the door. The best explanation is:"
  :options="[
    { text: 'Gravity pulls you sideways' },
    { text: 'Your body tends to keep moving straight (inertia)', correct: true },
    { text: 'Air resistance pushes you' },
    { text: 'The door attracts you' }
  ]"
  explanation="Your body wants to continue in a straight line. As the car curves away, you seem to move toward the door — that is inertia, not a real sideways pull."
/>

::: notes
- **Inertia** = resistance to change in motion; **mass** measures it.
- **1st Law:** if net force = 0, velocity stays constant (rest stays at rest).
- Motion needs **no** cause — only a *change* in motion needs a force.
- Watch for: bus jerk, coin-and-card trick, seatbelts.
